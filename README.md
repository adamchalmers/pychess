# pychess

PyChess is a simple chess client I designed to practice web apps. The goals were:

 * Teach me about practical web app design
 * Quickly share online chess games by URL, with no accounts needed
 * Practice security
 * Learn ES6
 
Not all of these goals have been completed yet :P

To run, just execute ```python server.py```.
